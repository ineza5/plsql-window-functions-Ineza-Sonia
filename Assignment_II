Student: Ineza Sonia ID: 27852 Course: Advanced Database Management (PL/SQL AUCA) Assignment: Oracle Database Environment (CDBs, PDBs & OEM)

This assignment focused on creating and managing Container and Pluggable Databases (CDBs & PDBs) in Oracle 21c, and setting up Oracle Enterprise Manager Express (OEM Express) for database monitoring and administration.

Environment Setup Oracle Version: Oracle Database 21c Enterprise Edition

Task 1 — Create a Pluggable Database

Connected as SYSDBA and verified root container.

Created the PDB using:

CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE in_pdb_27852 ADMIN USER ineza_plsqlauca_27852 IDENTIFIED BY auca FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ( 'C:\home\oradata\ORCL\pdbseed', 'C:\home\oradata\ORCL\in_pdb_27852' );

Opened and saved state:

ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE in_pdb_27852 OPEN; ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE in_pdb_27852 SAVE STATE;

Result: in_pdb_27852 created and opened successfully.

Task 2 — Create and Delete a PDB

Switched to the root container:

ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = CDB$ROOT;

Created another PDB with the required naming format:

CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE in_to_delete_pdb_27852 ADMIN USER in_admin_27852 IDENTIFIED BY auca FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ( 'C:\home\oradata\ORCL\pdbseed', 'C:\home\oradata\ORCL\in_to_delete_pdb_27852' );

Opened the new PDB and confirmed its status:

ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE in_to_delete_pdb_27852 OPEN; SELECT name, open_mode FROM v$pdbs WHERE name = 'IN_TO_DELETE_PDB_27852';

Deleted the PDB after verification:

ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE in_to_delete_pdb_27852 CLOSE IMMEDIATE; DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE in_to_delete_pdb_27852 INCLUDING DATAFILES;

PDB in_to_delete_pdb_27852 was successfully created, opened, verified, and deleted
